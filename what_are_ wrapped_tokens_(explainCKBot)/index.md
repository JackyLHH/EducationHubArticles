This article examines wrapped tokens: their workings, benefits, and implications for the future of decentralized finance.


## Understanding Wrapped Tokens

Cryptocurrency is built on the foundation of blockchain technology, a decentralized ledger which records transactions across a network of computers. Despite the revolutionary potential of blockchain, a significant hurdle it faces is the lack of interoperability between different blockchain networks. This is where the concept of wrapped tokens comes into play, serving as a bridge between disparate blockchain ecosystems.

Wrapped tokens are essentially digital assets that are pegged to the value of another asset and operate on a different blockchain than the asset they represent. For instance, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is a tokenized version of the BTC asset that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It maintains a one-to-one peg, meaning its value is always equivalent to that of BTC. The primary purpose of wrapped tokens is to increase interoperability between blockchains, allowing assets from one blockchain to be used on another.


## How Wrapped Tokens Work

Wrapped tokens’ operation combines the principles of tokenization, the role of custodians, and the utilization of smart contracts, to create a seamless bridge between different blockchain networks.

Tokenization involves converting the rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. The process begins with the original cryptocurrency being sent to a digital vault or a custodian. The custodian is a crucial player in this process, responsible for holding the original asset and ensuring its security. 

The custodian can be a trusted entity, a group of individuals, or even a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The key here is that the custodian must securely hold the equivalent amount of the original asset to back the wrapped version.

Once the original asset is secured with the custodian, a wrapped version of the token is created on the target blockchain. This creation is done through smart contracts – self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

A critical aspect of this process is a “mint and burn” mechanism. When the original asset is deposited with the custodian, the corresponding wrapped token is 'minted' or created on the other blockchain. 

Conversely, when the wrapped token is redeemed, it is 'burned' or destroyed, and the holder receives the equivalent amount of the original asset back from the custodian. This minting and burning mechanism ensures a balanced and secure relationship between the wrapped token and its underlying asset.

Once the wrapped token is minted, it can be used on its new blockchain, allowing for interactions that were previously impossible due to blockchain incompatibility. This opens up a world of possibilities, including using BTC for Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, something that would be impossible with the asset in its native form.

Wrapped tokens provide increased liquidity in the market, allowing assets to flow more freely across different blockchain networks. This liquidity is vital for the efficient functioning of DeFi platforms, where a wide range of assets can be utilized. Moreover, wrapped tokens enhance the utility of assets by enabling them to be used in new environments, broadening their potential use cases.


## Wrapped Tokens on Various Blockchain Platforms

While Ethereum is a popular platform for wrapped tokens, other blockchains like the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) also support them. Each blockchain has its own set of standards and protocols, and wrapped tokens allow assets from one chain to be used compliantly on another. For example, on BSC, assets like Bitcoin can be wrapped as BEP-20 tokens, allowing them to be used within the BSC ecosystem.


## Risks and Limitations of Wrapped Tokens

Despite their advantages, wrapped tokens are not without risks and limitations. The most significant concern is the need to trust the custodian responsible for holding the original asset. This introduces a degree of centralization in an otherwise decentralized ecosystem. Additionally, the process of wrapping and unwrapping tokens can sometimes be costly and complex, sometimes leading to inefficiencies.

Beyond custodial token wrapping protocols, decentralized solutions, which rely on self-executing smart contacts, are also subject to a significant array of risks. In this case, the most significant risk concerns the security of the smart contracts custodying the assets on the native chain or the one minting the wrapped assets on the target chain. Smart contracts have a long history of being exploited by hackers, resulting in losses now totalling billions of dollars.


## Conclusion

Wrapped tokens represent a significant innovation in the cryptocurrency space, offering a solution to the challenge of blockchain interoperability. By allowing assets from different blockchains to interact and be utilized in various ecosystems, they open up new possibilities in the realm of decentralized finance and beyond. 

Innovations in decentralized wrapping processes could further enhance the trustless nature of these tokens, aligning them more closely with the ethos of decentralization that underpins blockchain technology.
